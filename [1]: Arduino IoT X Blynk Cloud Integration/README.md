- Experiment Overview -
  
This project explores the integration of Arduino Cloud and Blynk Cloud on a single ESP32 microcontroller. Both platforms have limitations—Arduino Cloud allows control of up to 5 variables, and Blynk Cloud provides 5 virtual datastreams—making it rather limiting.

In this tutorial, I share a bare minimum setup that learners can use as a foundation to expand their IoT projects. This is intended for users with prior experience in Arduino Cloud and Blynk Cloud, aiming to maximize functionality while using the free-tier options.


- SETUP INSTRUCTION -
  
When you open the integration.ino file in the Arduino IDE, you will be prompted to create a new folder. Click "Yes" to proceed, then place the thingProperties.h file in that newly created folder. This step is essential for organizing your project files correctly.
